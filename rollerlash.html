What it is:
A mascara inspired by hair rollers, this super-curling and lifting mascara gives a sexy,
wide-eyed look. Its patent-pending Hook 'n' Roll brush features tiny custom-designed 
hooks to catch, lift, and curl even short and straight lashes. 

What it does:
Roller Lash not only lifts and super-curls, but this instant curve-setting formula holds
for 12 hours, is easy to remove, and contains provitamin B5 and serine, known for their 
lash-conditioning benefits. 

Research results:
In a consumer panel survey of 31 women for 4 weeks: 
- 97% said it visibly lifts lashes 
- 87% said it gives long-lasting curl 
- 94% said eyes look more wide open 

Beauty Tip: 
For super curl and length, apply Roller Lash first to curl and lift your lashes. Then layer 
They're Real! lengthening mascara on top.

This product is an Allure Best of Beauty award winner.
