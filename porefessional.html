What it is:
A professional balm that minimizes the appearance of pores. 

What it does:
Quickly minimize the appearance of pores and fine lines and help makeup stay put 
with this priming phenomenon. The silky and lightweight formula can be worn under 
makeup to create a smoother-than-smooth canvas or used throughout the day to 
mattify shine and touch up problem areas. It's so translucent, no one will know 
you're wearing anything! 

What else you need to know:
The oil-free formula contains vitamin E, which is known to protect skin from free 
radicals.</pre>
