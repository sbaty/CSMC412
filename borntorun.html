What it is:
A travel-ready eyeshadow palette with 21 shades for every possible eye look, from neutral to smoky and bright to sultry.

What it does:
If you find yourself packing multiple kits for one look, Urban Decay's Born To Run Eyeshadow Palette is your new globe-trotting go-to.

When it's time to grab your carry-on and dash off to the next big adventure,<br> you'll want to pack light. Enter Born To Run: an all-in-one eyeshadow palette<br> that has everything you need to create neutral looks, add in pops of color,<br> and play with bright shades, no matter where you're going. <br>With 21 of-the-moment shades—from jewel tones and modern neutrals to <br>more colorful shadows—you'll have every possible eye look covered in one sleek kit.<br> Made with UD's mind-blowing formula that gives each shade its velvety texture,<br> rich color, and superior blendability, Born To Run's eyeshadow shades <br>hold tightly onto pigment that stays put.

Have a conference in Dallas where you need to look like a boss? <br>Create subtle definition with creamy, light neutrals like Breakaway and <br>Weekender en route—using the palette's full-size mirror, of course. Or, blend Baja (a burnt orange matte) <br>into the lids and smudge Accelerate (a reddish copper metallic) into the <br>crease for a sunset-hued smoky eye that mirrors the view on your road trip through <br>the Mojave Desert. If you're dancing until daybreak in Prague, put a twist on the <br>traditional cat-eye look and smudge Guilt Trip (a smoky purple shimmer) into the lash line to create an imperfect wing.

Can't decide which awe-inspiring shade to swipe on next? No matter <br>which ones you try, UD designed them all to be universally flattering for any skin tone<br> and any lifestyle. Whether you're a total road warrior, a weekend escapist,<br> or a staycationer, this one palette has everything you need when you're Born To Run.
