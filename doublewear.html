What it does: 
Double Wear makeup gives you 24-hour staying power for a flawless, natural matte finish. This foundation 
unifies uneven skin tone and covers imperfections with buildable medium-to-full coverage. The makeup feels
 lightweight and so comfortable, you won't believe it is super long wear. The non-acnegenic formula won't 
clog pores, which may help avert breakouts, and helps control shine. It's waterproof, won't run, rub off, 
or smudge and lasts in hot and humid weather. 

Double Wear comes in Cool, Neutral and Warm undertones with shades that have been blended so they
 won't look grey on deeper skintones. 

What else you need to know: 
This product is fragrance-free and has been dermatologist tested. It is oil-free, mattifying, 
transfer-resistant, dermatologist-tested, non-acnegenic, and fragrance-free. </pre>
