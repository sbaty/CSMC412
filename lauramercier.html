What it is: 
A cult-favorite and award-winning, silky powder with a touch of sheer coverage to set makeup for lasting wear. 

What it does: 
Translucent Loose Setting Powder locks in makeup for long-lasting wear, without<br> adding weight or texture. This bestseller creates a modern, matte<br> finish with a touch of sheer coverage, while it absorbs oil and reduces shine all<br> day. The pros know why it's their favorite: the powder is a little denser than an <br>average powder, providing super smooth, even application and blending. <br>This no-flashback formula means you'll look great in photos, and it creates a <br>soft-focus effect to subtly blur the look of fine lines and imperfections. It <br>will not settle into fine lines or pores and never looks cakey. These truly <br>translucent shades work on all skin tonesâ€”from the fairest to the deepest. The <br>just-released, Translucent Medium Deep shade was designed to be completely <br>translucent on medium-deep to the deepest skin tones, ensuring that every skin <br>tone gets a perfectly flawless, translucent finish. 

Translucent: perfect for fair to medium and tan skin tones. 
Translucent Medium Deep: Ideal for medium-deep to the deepest skin tones. 

What else you need to know: 
Renowned Makeup Artist Laura Mercier uses Setting Powder to set foundation and<br> prolong its wear, so she applies it after foundation and concealer, and before<br> applying powder-based color. An added benefit: it helps powder blush or bronzer<br> go on more evenly. 

Find Your Perfect Powder: While makeup artists and beauty junkies select a powder based on texture, finish, and skin type, others may find it easiest to choose based on skin type alone. 

This professional-quality powder is noncomedogenic, non-caking, and dermatologist tested.
